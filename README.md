Raspberry
=========

Pong - Originally from a tutorial by Collin Green, http://muagames.com/tutorials/pygame-3-pong/pygame-3-pong-step-1/ .  This version has been modified to support control via an anologue input device on a Raspberry Pi, via an mcp3008 Analogue to Digital converter.  I've used a couple of potentiometers, but you could use anything that would give you a good resistance sweep with a maximum of about 10K ohms. 
MoodLight - A flask app server, serving a version of the Raphael.js colour picker example modified to post its data back to the server and update an attached Adafruit RGB led pixel chain.
